The MiNE ICO
======

This is the development repository for the token sale contracts of [The MiNE](http://themine.io).

The development environment needs `node`, `npm` and `Truffle` to be installed.

Then call `npm install` to fetch the dependencies (`zeppelin-solidity`):

```bash
cd themine-token/
npm install
truffle compile
truffle migrate
```
